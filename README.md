# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## MergeSort
### O(nlogn)
This algorithm works with the classic divide-and-conquer strategy. It divides the array into two subarrays, and continues doing that recursively, until it is left with single values. Then, it sorts those, by merging two arrays at a time.

## QuickSort
### O(nlogn)
This algorithm takes a pivot element and sorts the array in a way, that all elements left of the pivot are smaller than the pivot, while all elements right of the pivot are greater. This means that the pivot is now sorted. This is done recursively for each side until the array is sorted.
